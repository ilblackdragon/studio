# Setting up a database
This page describes the process of setting up your own database / storage for the models. This puts you in full control of who has access to the experiment data. 
For the moment, studioml only supports FireBase (https://firebase.google.com/) as a database/storage backend. 
To configure studioml to work with firebase, do the following:

## Creating firebase project and configuring TensorFlow Studio
1. Create a copy of studio/default_config.yaml file. Let's call it new_config.yaml
2. Create a new firebase project: go to https://firebase.google.com, sign in, click add project, specify project name
3. Go to project settings (little cogwheel next to "Overview" on a left-hand pane), tab "General"
4. Copy Web API key and paste it in apiKey of database section of new_config.yaml
5. Copy project ID and paste it in projectId of database section of new_config.yaml 
6. Go to "Cloud messaging tab", copy Sender ID and paste it in messagingSenderId of database section of new_config.yaml

## Configuring users
To enable email/password authentication within the Firebase client uncommented the use_email_auth tag in your new_config.yaml.
Add users. By default, firebase (both database and storage) grants read and write access to all authenticated users
Go to Authentication in Firebase console (on left-hand pane), tab sign-in methods, and enable methods that you would like to use. For now, studio supports google account authentication, and email/password authentication.
If you have choosen to use the email/password method for authentication, use the Users tab of the Authentication panel to manually add yourself with a password.  This password is not shared by other google services, if this is what you want then google account based authentication is needed, therefore you should always use a unique password.
Further, you can customize the database / storage access rules (good read for that is https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/ and https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security/start)
The default rules allow read and write access to all authenticated users, to both storage and database. This might not be quite the behaviour that you would want, because then users can freely delete / modify experiments of each other. 
To make experiments readable by everyone, but writeable only by creator, a bit more involved rules are needed. The examples of such rules (that are used at the default studio firebase app) are given in `auth/firebase_db.rules` and `auth/firebase_storage.rules` for database and storage. 

## Setting up an authentication app for google account authentication
1. Create a new Firebase project from the [console] (https://console.firebase.google.com) 
2. Under the authentication tab in the console, turn on the Google authentication provider 
3. Install Firebase CLI (https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/)
4. We will be deploying a firebase app, so the following is the summary of (https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/deploying). The app iteslf is a modified authentication code example from here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/samples/
5. Go to studio/auth folder and run 

        firebase init
6. Select Hosting by pressing space, press Enter to continue
7. Select the right firebase project (if you have more than one)
8. Answer 'N' to the remaining questions
9. Run 
    
        firebase deploy
10. To test successful deployment, go the <hosting_url>/index.html url (where hosting_url was output by firebase deploy). You should see page titled "Firebase Authentication" that either has a button "SIGN IN" or "SIGN OUT" and your authentication details below. 


## Test run
Go to the studio/helloworld/ folder, and run 

        studio run --config /path/to/new_config.yaml train_mnist_keras.py 10
        
(10 stands for the number of training epochs). You should be prompted for your user email and password (if you have uncommented use_email_auth in new_config.yaml), or block to wait for studio to authenticate. When entering email/password combinations you may be prompted several times to enter your details. Then (or in another terminal) run 

        studio ui --config /path/to/new_config.yaml
        
and go to http://localhost:5000 in the browser to see the results of the experiment.
