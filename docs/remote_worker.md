# Setting up a remote worker
This page describes a procedure for setting up a remote worker for studio. Remote workers are listening to the queue; once a worker receives a message from the queue, it starts the experiments

## I. Getting credentials 
1. Remote workers work by listening to distributed queue. Right now the distributed queue is backed by Google PubSub; so to access it, you'll need application credentials from Google. (in the future, it may be implemented via firebase itself, in which case this step should become obsolete). If you made it this far, you are likely to have a google cloud compute account set up; but even if not, go to http://cloud.google.com and either set up an account or sign in. 
2. Next, create a project if you don't have a project corresponding to studio just yet. 
3. Then go to API Manager -> Credentials, and click "Create credentials" -> "Service account key"
4. Choose "New service account" from the "Select accout" dropdown,  and keep key type as JSON
5. Enter a name of your liking for account (google will convert it to a uniqie name), and choose "PubSub Editor" for a role (technically, you can create 2 keys, and keep publisher on a machine that submits work, and subscriber key on a machine that implements the work)
6. Save a json credentials file
7. Add GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable to the environment that points to the saved json credentials file both on work submitter and work implementer. 

## II. Setting up remote worker
1. Install docker, and nvidia-docker to use gpus
2. Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/ilblackdragon/studio && cd studio && pip install -e .
 
   To check success of installation, you can run `python $(which nosetests)` to run the tests (may take about 10 min to finish)

3. Start worker (queue name is a name of the queue that will definte where submit work to)
    
    studio-start-remote-worker <queue-name>

## III. Submitting work
On a submitting machine (usually local):

    studio-runner --queue <queue-name> script.py <script_args>

This script should quit promptly, but you'll be able to see experiment progress in studio web ui
