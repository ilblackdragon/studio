# Configuring studioml to work with Amazon EC2 cloud
This page describes the process of setting configuring studio to work with Amazon EC2
We assume that you have an AWS account set up already, and AWS credentials. 

## Install boto3
studioml interacts with AWS via boto3 API. Thus, in order to use EC2 cloud, you'll need to install boto3:

    pip install boto3

## Set up credentials
Add credentials to the location where boto3 can access them. The recommended way is to install AWS CLI:

    pip install awscli

and then run

    aws configure

and enter AWS credentials and region. The output format cam be left as None. Alternatively, use any method of
letting boto3 know the credentials described here: http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html
